# house_price_prediction
## Overview

Predicting house prices using machine learning models trained on historical data to provide accurate estimates for real estate valuation.
The system relies on the `California Housing Prices` dataset for its predictions.

## Linear Regression
Linear Regression utilized the linear relationship between features and prices for straightforward predictions

## Random Forest Regression
Random Forest Regression leveraged an ensemble of decision trees to capture complex patterns.

## Conclusion

In this house price prediction project, we embarked on a journey of data exploration, cleaning, and model development. After careful preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization, we created three models: 
1. Model_1 - linear regression 
2. Model_2 - random forest regression 
3. Model_3 - random forest regression with scaled data 

The standout performer was the random forest regression model, achieving an impressive `81%` prediction accuracy. This underscores the significance of choosing the right algorithm and features in predictive modeling.

In summary, this project demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in real estate analysis, with the random forest regression model showcasing the potential for accurate house price predictions.
